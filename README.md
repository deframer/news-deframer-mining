# News Deframer - Trend Mining Engine

This is the Trend Mining component for the main [News Deframer](https://github.com/deframer/news-deframer) project.

## Why Trend Mining?

This component shows current talking points and visualizes rising trends over time. It also allows comparing coverage across different news sources and countries.

As a bonus, it helps to uncover "blind spots." Relying on a small set of news feeds can create gaps regarding important events. By showing what others are reading, this helps to discover relevant content outside of the usual bubble.

This approach may be based on the findings in this [PhD Thesis](https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/fub188/7212/streibel-diss-online-1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).
